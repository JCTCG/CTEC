Welcome to CTEC(Cool Technology) source code library!

CTEC has deployed a high security, high performance infrastructure based on blockchain. On top of this architecture, developers can build and deploy additional, scaleable, alternative blockchain architectures. Also can develop other distributed applications, such as: games, payment, travel, DAPP,...

After the release of the CTEC source code, many of the early experimenters have run some private nodes for testing . Many related applications have been developed. It is believed that CTEC will have a broader application prospect in the future.

Note: CTEC was released on Jan. 8, 2020.
